<h5>Finding Prime Pairs</h5>
Using C++ and OpenMP, write a parallel program that counts the number of primes less than n for any number n
and also find and list all the twin primes (5,7), (11,13) less than n.
The main objective is to use parallel programming to produce efficient code using multiple threads. The finished program is timed and
rated while using different amounts of threads. The Max threads for my machine is 6. primes_seq is the baseline without any OpenMp <br>
